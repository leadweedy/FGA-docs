# Can't install

Is your phone/emulator Android 7 or newer? If not and you tried to install, I feel sorry for you :cry:

# Doesn't work at all on Emulator

# Worked before, doesn't work now

Your phone manufacturer's battery optimization is killing the app.

1. Go to https://dontkillmyapp.com and follow the steps properly for your phone manufacturer.
   I mean it when I say properly. I've had cases of people not following those instructions properly and wasting my time for no reason.
2. Restart your phone after following the above steps. You might be able to get away by Force Closing or Clearing the Cache for the app.
3. If that doesn't work, see if there are apps on your phone that can kill FGA, like some 3rd party battery saver.
4. If still doesn't work, there's nothing more I can do for you. There's no point in bothering me with this issue, it's how your phone works.

# Keeps asking for Accessibility even after turning it ON

Same steps as [Worked before, doesn't work now](#worked-before-doesnt-work-now)

# Uses skills on wrong servant or doesn't use skills at all

Do you have skill confirmation ON in FGO?
If so, either turn that OFF or turn ON `More options/Skill confirmtaion` in FGA.

# Not picking NP/cards on Attack screen OR Got stuck in some info screen

Is it just your phone lagging badly? If so, either get a new phone or try increasing the delays in `More options/Fine-tune`.

# Doesn't work on some screens

1. Check that you're not placing the PLAY button in a wierd place.  
   See [Where should I place the PLAY button?](#where-should-i-place-the-play-button)

2. Is there some overlay on your phone/emulator screen which can screw up image matching?  
   For example:
   ![overlay](img/overlay.jpg)

# Where should I place the PLAY button?

If you have a non-16:9 phone, it is best to place the PLAY button outside FGO on the blue borders.

If your phone is 16:9, the default placement at bottom-left corner is ideal. While you can drag the button around to other places, there is possibility of screwing things up if it comes in the way of image matching.
