## Why can't I find it on PlayStore?
~~The app was unlisted until proper JP support.~~ See [#616](https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA/issues/616).  
It won't be made available on PlayStore again. You can download it from the link on the README page.

## Why does it show an error when installing?
Your phone/emulator should be Android 7 or later to use the app.  
The latest version of Nox doesn't work.

## Can't find 'Script Mode' option?
The app automatically detects which script can be run on the current screen.  
It will show the relevant option when you click on the PLAY button.

## Having trouble on Emulators?

See [Running on Emulators](Running-on-Emulators)

# IMPORTANT: Make sure the game looks as FGA wants it to

If you're having trouble, this is mostly related.
See [Game Area detection](Game-Area-detection)

## Can't start scripts (Mostly LG/Samsung phones)?

For LG:
Turn OFF Game Tools since it has the feature to prevent ALERTS from showing up.  
This prevents the dialog which lets you pick AutoSkill config from showing up.

On other phones, if you have something like a Game Booster that blocks alerts from other apps when playing a game, turn it OFF.
Instructions would vary depending on your device, so Google.

## Worked before, doesn't work now

See [#314](https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA/issues/314)

## Keeps asking for Accessibility even after turning it ON

See [#314](https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA/issues/314)

## Uses skills on the wrong servant or doesn't use skills at all

Do you have skill confirmation ON in FGO?
If so, either turn that OFF or turn ON `More options/Skill confirmation in FGA.

## Not picking NP/cards on Attack screen OR Got stuck in some info screen

Is it just your phone lagging badly? If so, either get a new phone or try increasing the delays in `More options/Fine-tune`.

## Doesn't work on some screens

1. Check that you're not placing the PLAY button in a weird place.  
   See [Where should I place the PLAY button?](#where-should-i-place-the-play-button)

2. Is there some overlay on your phone/emulator screen that can screw up image matching?  
   For example:
   
   <img src="img/overlay.jpg" width="500">

## Where should I place the PLAY button?

If you have a non-16:9 phone, it is best to place the PLAY button outside FGO on the blue borders (until the wide-screen update).  
Bottom-left corner is ideal after the wide screen update.

If your phone is 16:9, the default placement at the bottom-left corner is ideal. While you can drag the button around to other places, there is a possibility of screwing things up if it comes in the way of image matching.
