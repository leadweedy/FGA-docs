Gift Box script is just for receiving all Silver and some Gold embers from your present Box.

You can configure the maximum set size of gold embers you want to receive in `More options`.

The script will stop automatically when it picks 99 items. If there are not enough items to pick, you'll have to stop it manually.

After the script ends, you can receive the embers by clicking yourself on `Receive Selected` in the game.
