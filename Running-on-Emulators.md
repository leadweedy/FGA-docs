> FGA doesn't seem to work on latest version of Nox

On Nox, FGA needs Root to work since MediaProjection doesn't seem to work.

- Make sure you're using an **Android 7** instance of Nox.
  Use [MultiDrive](https://www.bignox.com/blog/how-to-run-multiple-android-instances-with-nox-app-player/) for managing/creating Nox instances.
- Go to `More options` in the app and turn ON `Use Root for Screenshots`.
- You also need to enable `Root` from Nox's settings. See [How to root Nox](https://www.bignox.com/blog/how-to-root-nox-app-player/).

## Bluestacks

On Bluestacks you can use FGA without Root.

#### Bluestacks on Windows needs extra steps
Change to Compatibility Graphics Engine:

- Open Bluestack's settings
- Go to `Engine` tab.
- Set `Graphics Engine` to `Compatibility`.
- Save settings and Restart Bluestacks.
