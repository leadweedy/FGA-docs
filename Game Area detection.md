## How FGO should look

For FGA to work, FGO should be centered on your phone's screen excluding notch (hole on screen for front camera)

This is what your phone should look like:

1. If it's 16:9, there's not much problem.

2. Not 16:9, no notch. FGO should be centered on screen. The borders around FGO should be blue in such cases.

3. Not 16:9, but has a notch. FGO should be centered in the area exluding notch. The borders around FGO should be blue excluding the notch region which should be black.
